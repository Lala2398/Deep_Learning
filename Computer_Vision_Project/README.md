# Project : [MNIST Object Detection with YOLO](https://github.com/Lala2398/Deep_Learning/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Project/Yolo_V8_MNIST%20data)

This repository showcases computer vision object detection using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the YOLO library.

### Project Overview:

This project implements a YOLO model to detect handwritten digits in MNIST images.

The code is concise and focuses on core functionalities.

Extensive data (images and graphs) is provided in separate zip files for visualization and analysis.

Contents:
[data.zip:](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)   This zip file holds the MNIST dataset used for training and testing. 
[runs.zip:](https://github.com/Lala2398/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Computer_Vision_Project/Yolo_V8_MNIST%20data/runs-20240403T093051Z-001.zip) This zip file contains various images and graphs generated during training and evaluation. 

### Requirements:

Python / YOLO library

### Getting Started:

Download the required zip files (data.zip and results.zip).

Install the necessary Python libraries.

Run the training notebook.

### Note:

The code is intended to be concise and demonstrate the core functionalities.

The provided zip files offer additional resources for visualization and in-depth analysis.

### Further Exploration:

The results.zip file allows you to explore:

Training and validation loss curves.

Sample images with detected digits.

Performance metrics on the test set.

### Feel free to:

Modify the code to experiment with different YOLO configurations.

Visualize additional results from the results.zip file.

I hope this project provides a clear and focused example of YOLO for object detection on MNIST data.
