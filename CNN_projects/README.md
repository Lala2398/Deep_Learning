# Project : [HotDogProject_CNN_binaryclassification](https://github.com/Lala2398/Deep_Learning/blob/main/CNN_projects/HotDogProject_CNN_binaryclassification.ipynb)

This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification, specifically identifying hot dogs in images.

### Project Goal:

This project aims to develop a CNN model capable of distinguishing between images containing hot dogs and those without.

### Requirements:

Python 

TensorFlow

Additional libraries used in the code (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### Getting Started:

Clone this repository.

Install the required Python libraries.

Download the image datasets for training and testing. 

Run the training notebook.


### Contribution:

This repository welcomes contributions! If you have improvements or additional functionalities, feel free to submit a pull request.


I hope this project provides a valuable example of using CNNs for binary image classification.
